<h2>Expressions</h2>

<section>
	<p>
		Expressions let you present the current value of properties in other elements and perform simple computations.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Using Expressions</h1>

	<p>By default, Mavo expressions are delineated by square brackets, e.g. <code>[5 + 5]</code>.
		We explored many different syntaxes and found that format to have the best readability.
		However, if you are concerned about potential false positives, you can change that with the <code>mv-expressions</code> attribute.
		For example, to switch to a double curly brace syntax (common in many other systems), you can use <code>mv-expressions="{{ }}"</code>.
		To disable expressions in an element and its descendants altogether, use <code>mv-expressions="none"</code>.
	</p>

	<p>If you are concerned about the expression content being shown while the page loads, you can use the <a href="#mv-value"><code>mv-value</code></a> attribute instead, and provide a fallback as content.</p>

	<section class="example">
		<h1>Example: Using mv-value</h1>
		<script type="text/plain">
			<p>Slider value: <span mv-value="strength">0</span>/100</p>
			<input type="range" property="strength" />
		</script>
	</section>

	<p class="note"><code>mv-value</code> does not require braces or whatever other syntax you have defined, and including them could result in unpredictable behavior.</p>

	<p>If your expression contains a mistake, the expression itself will be shown instead of a result.
		If you’re using <code>mv-value</code> however, its fallback content will be shown instead.</p>

	<section class="example">
		<h1>Example: Incorrect expressions</h1>
		<script type="text/plain">
			[5 +]
			<div mv-value="5 +">Fallback</div>
		</script>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Syntax</h1>

	<p>Mavo expressions are similar to JavaScript, but much simpler. You can read more about the expression language <a href="/docs/mavoscript">here</a>.
	Do not worry if you are more experienced: Mavo expressions can also be made to contain arbitrary JavaScript!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Basics</h1>

	<p>You can dynamically refer to the value of any property you have defined, anywhere, by putting its name inside brackets (like this: <code>[propertyName]</code>).</p>

	<section class="example">
		<p>Move the slider and check how both expressions are updated:</p>
		<script type="text/plain">
			<p>Slider value: [strength]/100</p>
			<input type="range" property="strength" title="[strength]%" />
		</script>
	</section>

	<p>We can also do math with properties, e.g. divide by 100:</p>

	<section class="example">
		<p>Move the slider and check how both expressions are updated:</p>
		<script type="text/plain">
			<p>Slider value: [strength/100]</p>
			<input type="range" property="strength" title="[strength]%" />
		</script>
	</section>

	<p>If you set a <code>property</code> attribute on an element containing an expression, you can use that property in other expressions too, regardless of whether they come before or after the element.</p>

	<section class="example color-picker">
		<p>Making a bare-bones HSL color picker with Mavo expressions:</p>
		<script type="text/plain">
			<div style="background-color: [color];">
				<input type="range" property="hue" max="360" />
				<input type="range" property="saturation" />
				<input type="range" property="lightness" />

				<input property="color" value="hsl([hue], [saturation]%, [lightness]%)" readonly />
			</div>
		</script>
	</section>

	<p class="tip">If you’re just using an element to hold an intermediate result so you can refer to it, we recommend using
		<code>&lt;meta property="propertyName" content="[expression]" /></code> which is hidden, both semantically and visually.
	</p>

	<p class="note">Properties whose values are expressions are called <em>“computed properties”</em> and are <strong>not saved</strong>.</p>

</section>

<section id="functions">
	<h1>Expression functions</h1>

	<p>References and simple arithmetic are useful, but not always enough.
		For this purpose, Mavo defines a number of <a href="/docs/mavoscript/#math-functions">common math functions</a> you can use inside expressions, such as:
		<code>pow(base, exponent)</code>, <code>round(number, decimals)</code>, <code>sqrt(number)</code> and <a href="/docs/mavoscript/#math-functions">many more</a>.</p>

	<section class="example pow">
		<script type="text/plain">
			<input property="base" type="number" value="2" />
			<input property="exponent" type="number" value="3" /> = [pow(base, exponent)]
		</script>
	</section>

	<p class="note">If what you’re printing contains characters other than letters, numbers and underscores,
		you will need to use quotes around it, just like in CSS <code>font-family</code> or HTML attributes.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Expressions and groups</h1>

	<p>If there are groups and there are properties with the same name inside and outside the group,
		the value <strong>closest to your expression</strong> will be used, with parent groups having priority over inner groups.</p>

	<section class="example scoped-expressions">
		<h1>Example: Grouping & Expressions</h1>
		<script type="text/plain">
			<p>Hi, I’m [firstname] [lastname]</p> <!-- From inner group -->

			<div property="person">
				<span property="firstname">Lea</span>
				<span property="lastname">Verou</span>
				<p>Hi, I’m [firstname] [lastname]</p>

				<div property="mother">
					<span property="firstname">Maria</span>
					<!-- Last name from parent group -->
					<p>Hi, I’m [firstname] [lastname]</p>

					<div property="mother">
						<span property="firstname">Areti</span>
						<!-- Last name from grandparent group -->
						<p>Hi, I’m [firstname] [lastname]</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</script>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Expressions and lists</h1>

	<p>Using a property with multiple values (i.e. referring to a property inside a list from outside the list) in an expression is not very useful on its own.
		However, there are functions that help you use such lists of values in interesting ways, such as <code>count(propery)</code>, <code>sum(property)</code>, <code>average(property)</code> and <a href="mavoscript/#list-functions">more</a>.
	</p>

	<section class="example">
		<p>Try adding and removing elements!</p>

		<script type="text/plain">
		<div property="foo">
			<h2>My cats</h2>
			<ul>
				<li property="cat" mv-multiple>
					<div property="name">Vector</div>
					<div property="age">10</div>
					<!-- Note that expression inside list item refers to the value in the current item -->
					<p>Age in 2 years: [age + 2]</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>My cats’ ages</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>All cat ages: [age]</li>
				<li>Number of cats: [count(cat)]</li>
				<li>Number of cats with age: [count(age)]</li>
				<li>Average cat age: [average(age)]</li> <!-- avg(age) also works -->
				<li>Sum of all ages (why? because we can): [SUM(age)]</li> <!-- caps don’t matter -->
				<li>Number of cats over 5 years old: [count(age > 5)]</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		</script>
		<script type="application/json">{"foo": {
	"cat": [
		{
			"name": "Vector",
			"age": 10
		},
		{
			"name": "Jean"
		},
		{
			"name": "Pixel",
			"age": 6
		},
		{
			"name": "Adam Catlace",
			"age": 2.5
		},
		{
			"name": "Eva"
		},
		{
			"name": "Chlebis",
			"age": 8
		}
	]
}}</script>
	</section>

	<p>Note that if your expression is inside a list item, any properties inside that item will refer to their current values,
	whereas if your expression is outside the collection you will get all values.</p>

	<hr />

	<p>You can also do math or comparisons with lists. For example, <code>[sum(age + 5)]</code> will add 5 to every age and then sum the result.
		You can use either symbols (e.g. <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>></code>, <code>==</code>) etc to perform these operations, or <a href="mavoscript/#math-functions">their function counterparts</a>.
	</p>

</section>
<section>
	<h1>Conditionals: if() and the mv-if attribute</h1>

	<p>You can use the <code>if(condition, ifyes, ifno)</code> function to print out different text depending on a condition.
	The second parameter is optional: If you omit it, nothing will be printed out if the condition is false.</p>

	<p>
		The <code>if()</code> function is very powerful, but can be confusing when all you want is to toggle content.
		For this, you can also use the <code>mv-if</code> attribute to hide or show content based on the value of an expression.
		Just like <code>mv-value</code>, <code>mv-if</code> does not require braces or other syntax.
		Besides readability, <code>mv-if</code> has another benefit: elements hidden with it are completely removed from the page, not just hidden.</p>
	</p>

	<section class="example movie">
		<script type="text/plain">
			<style>
				.movie .bad { background: #fee; }
				.movie .ok { background: #ffe; }
				.movie .good { background: #efd; }
			</style>

			<div mv-storage class="[if(rating < 3, bad, if(rating > 3, good, ok))]">
				<label>Rating:
					<input property="rating" type="range" min="1" max="5" />
				</label>

				<p mv-if="rating = 1">Wow, you hated that movie!</p>
				<p mv-if="rating > 3">Glad you liked it!</p>
			</div>
		</script>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>mv-value</h1>

	<p>We’ve seen in the introduction how <code>mv-value</code> can be used to create fallback content for expressions. However, it’s much more powerful than that.
	When used on a collection, mv-value renders its value <strong>on the entire collection</strong>, enabling you to create lists of items that depend on other lists.</p>

	<p>As a simple example, note how these two lists are synchronized:</p>

	<section class="example">
		<script type="text/plain">
			<div><span property="list1" mv-multiple mv-mode="edit">[$index + 1]</span></div>
			<div><span property="list2" mv-multiple mv-value="list1"></span></div>
		</script>
