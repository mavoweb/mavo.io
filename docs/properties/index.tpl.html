<h2>Storage</h2>

<section>
	<p>
		The <code>property</code> attribute tells Mavo which elements are important, e.g. are saved, editable, used in expressions, or all three.
		Elements with this attribute are often referred to as <em>properties</em> or <em>property elements</em>.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Property name rules</h1>

	<p>Its value should describe the element, similarly to a <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> attribute. It can contain <strong>only</strong> letters, numbers and underscores (_).
		If it happens to be the same as the element’s <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> attributes, you don’t need to provide a value.
		For example, the following are all equivalent:
	</p>

	<script type="text/plain">
		<div property class="name">Lea Verou</div>
		<div property id="name">Lea Verou</div>
		<div property="name">Lea Verou</div>
	</script>

	<p>If you need inspiration for names, you could look at <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Editing</h1>

	<p>If the <code>property</code> attribute is used on elements that are not form elements, they are made editable, and Mavo generates a button
	for switching between modes:</p>

	<section class="example">
		<script type="text/plain">
			<span property="firstName">Lea</span> <span property="last_name">Verou</span>
			<span>- I don’t have a property attribute, so I’m not editable.</span>
		</script>
	</section>

	<hr />

	<p>You can put the <code>property</code> attribute on <strong>any</strong> HTML5 element, and mavo knows how to make it editable:</p>

	<section class="example">
		<script type="text/plain">
			<meter property="rating" min="1" value="3" max="5"></meter>
			<time property="birthday" datetime="2014-06-01">1 Jun 2014</time>
			<img property="avatar" src="http://i.imgur.com/LPeWcag.png" />
		</script>
	</section>

	<p>Mavo can also be taught about new element types with different ways to be edited (e.g. rich text), via <a href="https://plugins.mavo.io">plugins</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h1>The mv-attribute attribute</h1>

	<p>Mavo automatically assumes that the data each property element holds is stored either as its content or in a "primary" attribute, different per element type.
		Most of the time this works great, and you don't have to think about it. However, sometimes this heuristic will fail.
		In those cases, you can correct Mavo's prediction by using the <code>mv-attribute</code> attribute.
		Its value is either the name of the attribute that holds data, or <code>null</code> for no attribute (element contents).</p>

	<p>For example, an <code>&lt;a></code> element's primary data attribute is <code>href</code>.
		However, sometimes you want to make the content editable instead, and even reference it in the <code>href</code> attribute via an expression.
		You can use the <code>mv-attribute</code> for that:</p>

	<section class="example">
		<script type="text/plain">
			<a href="mailto:[email]" property="email" mv-attribute="null">lea@mavo.io</a>
		</script>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>The mv-mode attribute</h1>
	<p>Possible values: <code>edit</code> or <code>read</code>.
		The purpose of this attribute is twofold: If set by you on a property, this property (and any descendant properties that don't have their own <code>mv-mode</code> attribute) become read-only or edit-only, regardless of whether the Mavo app is in edit mode or not.
		This is useful for creating "constants": Properties that are saved but not edited. It's also useful for properties (or entire apps, if you use <code>mv-mode</code> on the Mavo wrapper) that don't make sense in read mode.
		This attribute is also used by Mavo: properties that are being edited have <code>mv-mode="edit"</code>. This means you can use the CSS selector <code>[mv-mode="edit"]</code> to style properties differently when they are being edited.
