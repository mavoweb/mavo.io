					"content": "Hooks are used as ways to execute custom code during various points of Mavo's execution. The name of the hook gives a summary of where the hook will be executed and usually follows the scheme `\"_CLASS_NAME_-_METHOD_NAME_-_LOCATION_\"`.\n\nSome examples:\n\n| Hook name | Executes | Definition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [mavo.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/mavo.js#L58) |\n| `node-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Node` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [node.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/node.js#L45) |\n| `group-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Group` constructor, after its parent constructor (`Mavo.Node`) has been called. | [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L11) |\n| `node-getdata-end` | Called right before `getData()` returns its value, to give plugins a chance to intercept and manipulate it. Note that a hook can be called multiple times in different places. | [collection.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/collection.js#L80) [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L125) [primitive.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/primitive.js#L236) |\n\nLinks to the source code might not link to the exact hook definition as the code changes. Look a few lines above or below, it should be close.\n\n## Adding code to a hook\n\nYou can add a hook by calling `Mavo.hooks.add(\"hook-name\", callback)`. If you have multiple hooks, you can also pass an object, like so:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.hooks.add({\n\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nYou could also add code to hooks as one of the options in `Mavo.Plugins.register()`:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.plugins.register(\"myplugin\", {\n\t\t\t\thooks: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nThe `env` object differs depending on the hook. For hooks run in instance methods of classes, `env` is an object that contains references to all important local variables so you can modify them in your plugin. If there are none, it just refers to the current instance. The context of the function (the `this` variable) is the current instance. This means that you could use a custom build of Mavo to experiment, then copy over your code to hooks without having to make changes to it.\n\n## Available hooks\n\nMavo calls `Mavo.hooks.run(\"hook-name\", data)` to run the code added at a hook. Therefore, you can [search Mavo’s code for `Mavo.hooks.run(`](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Mavo.hooks.run%28&type=) and you will find all available hooks as well as where in the code they are executed.\n\nYou never need to run `Mavo.hooks.run()` yourself, unless you want to create hooks for your own plugin, i.e. allow other people to create plugins of your plugin (\"metaplugins\"? \"pluginception\"? 😜). In that case please prefix the hook names with your plugin id, to prevent collisions with other plugins.\n\n## Limitations\n\nHooks cannot change the return value of a function, unless the calling code has enabled that via a property on `env`. For example, in the `node-getdata-end` hook described above, all you need to do to change the return value is modify `env.data`.\n\nIn the future this may become possible, so avoid returning non-undefined values from your callbacks to make sure your plugin doesn’t break when this is enabled.\n\n## Need a hook that doesn’t exist yet?\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/issues/new) and chances are we’ll add it pretty soon. Make sure to describe what you’re trying to do!"
