					"content": "Hooks are used as ways to execute custom code during various points of Mavo's execution. The name of the hook gives a summary of where the hook will be executed and usually follows the scheme `\"CLASS_NAME-METHOD_NAME-LOCATION\"`.\n\nSome examples:\n\n| Hook name | Executes | Definition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [mavo.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/mavo.js#L58) |\n| `node-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Node` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [node.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/node.js#L45) |\n| `group-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Group` constructor, after its parent constructor (`Mavo.Node`) has been called. | [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L11) |\n| `node-getdata-end` | Called right before `getData()` returns its value, to give plugins a chance to intercept and manipulate it. Note that a hook can be called multiple times in different places. | [collection.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/collection.js#L80) [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L125) [primitive.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/primitive.js#L236) |\n\nNote: Links to the source code might not link to the exact hook definition as the code changes. Look a few lines above or below, it should be close.\n\n## Adding code to a hook\n\nYou can add a hook by calling `Mavo.hooks.add(\"hook-name\", callback)`. If you have multiple hooks, you can also pass an object, like so:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.hooks.add({\n\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nYou could also add code to hooks as one of the options in `Mavo.Plugins.register()`:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.plugins.register(\"myplugin\", {\n\t\t\t\thooks: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nThe `env` object differs depending on the hook. For hooks run in instance methods of classes, `env` is an object that contains references to all important local variables so you can modify them in your plugin. If there are none, it just refers to the current instance. The context of the function (the `this` variable) is the current instance. This means that you could use a custom build of Mavo to experiment, then copy over your code to hooks without having to make changes to it.\n\n## Available hooks\n\nMavo calls `Mavo.hooks.run(\"hook-name\", data)` to run the code added at a hook. Therefore, you can [search Mavo’s code for `Mavo.hooks.run(`](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Mavo.hooks.run%28&type=) and you will find all available hooks as well as where in the code they are executed.\n\nYou never need to run `Mavo.hooks.run()` yourself, unless you want to create hooks for your own plugin, i.e. allow other people to create plugins of your plugin (\"metaplugins\"? \"pluginception\"? 😜). In that case please prefix the hook names with your plugin id, to prevent collisions with other plugins.\n\n## Limitations\n\nHooks cannot change the return value of a function, unless the calling code has enabled that via a property on `env`. For example, in the `node-getdata-end` hook described above, all you need to do to change the return value is modify `env.data`.\n\nIn the future this may become possible, so avoid returning non-undefined values from your callbacks to make sure your plugin doesn’t break when this is enabled.\n\n## Need a hook that doesn’t exist yet?\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/issues/new) and chances are we’ll add it pretty soon. Make sure to describe what you’re trying to do!"

When a Mavo allows login but the current user is not logged in, `mv-permissions` will include the value `login`. You can use this in your CSS to style things differently based on whether the current user is logged in.\n\nFor example, let's say you have an `auth` class and you want to only show anything with that class to authenticated users. You can do this with this CSS:\n\n```css\n\n\t\t[mv-permissions~=\"login\"] .auth {\n\t\t\tdisplay: none;\n\t\t}\n\n```\n\nNote the [`~=` in the attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) above. This allows you to match for one value in a space-separated list, instead of the entire attribute.\n\nFor convenience, there are also `mv-logged-in` and `mv-logged-out` classes that you can use on your HTML to show things only to logged in or logged out users respectively."

					"id": "bar",

It’s typically specified on the Mavo root. Buttons are represented by their ids. You can find the ids of the built-in buttons below, but keep in mind that [Plugins](https://plugins.mavo.io) may add more:\n\n| id | Default? | Button |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| status | ✓ | Displays currently logged in info for backends that support login |\n| edit | ✓ | Edit button |\n| save | ✓ | Save button |\n| import | | Upload a JSON file and override current data. |\n| export | | Download current data as a JSON file. |\n| login | ✓ | Login button |\n| logout | ✓ | Logout button |\n\nJust including a series of ids in the `mv-bar` attribute **restricts the toolbar to these buttons, in that order**.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"import export edit save\">\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nHowever, often we only want to **add or remove a few buttons to the default set**. With the syntax above, we would need to remember all default ids and their default order in order to specify the buttons we want. This is why `mv-bar` also supports a **relative** syntax: by starting the value with `with` all values are interpreted as relative to the default set of buttons. You can then remove buttons by using a `no-` prefix and add buttons by just specifying their ids.\n\nNote that the edit button is still there, even though we didn't have to explicitly specify it.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"with import export no-save\"> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote: The `with` keyword can be omitted if there’s at least one `no-*`.\n\nTip: Want to **hide the Mavo bar from logged out users**? Use `mv-bar=\"no-login\"`. You can still log in without a Mavo toolbar, by adding `?login` to the page URL. Note that browsers often block popups more aggressively when they are not triggered by a click so you may need to manually approve the authentication popup when using this.\n\n# Hide the toolbar completely\n\nUse `mv-bar=\"none\"`. You can then use classes like `mv-status`, `mv-edit`, `mv-save`, `mv-clear`, `mv-login`, `mv-logout` etc on your own buttons to provide the corresponding functionality. However, note that if you choose to go this route, **these buttons will be always shown**, regardless of whether the user has permission for the corresponding action. You can use an `mv-permissions` attribute selector to fix this.\n\n# Change its placement and/or use your own HTML element for it\n\nJust use `class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\"` on your desired element.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\">\n\t<div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\" style=\"background: blue\">\n\t\tYOLO\n\t</div>\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n# Remove default styling\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and omit the `mv-ui` class:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\"> \n\t<div class=\"mv-bar\">YOLO</div> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div> \n</div>\n```\n\nThis is useful when you want a completely different styling and would rather start from a blank state. You can see a real example of custom toolbar styling on the [SVG Paths](/demos/svgpath) demo.\n\n# Custom button elements\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and include your custom button inside it with the appropriate `mv-BUTTON_ID` class. For example, to have a Save button with the text \"Store\" instead of \"Save\", you could do:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\">\n\t<div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\">\n\t\t<button class=\"mv-save\">Store</button>\n\t</div>\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```"

Please note that `lang` is not a Mavo attribute, it’s an HTML attribute and its values are described in any HTML documentation.\n\nWarning: Please try to avoid locales with hyphens unless you absolutely need to. E.g. it's better to define a general French (`lang=\"fr\"`) locale and another Canadian French (Québécois) locale (`lang=\"fr-ca\"`) with only the phrases that are different. The reason is that any French dialect can fall back to general French, but not to a specific dialect of French, which means that even if you have defined a locale for `fr-ca`, apps with `lang=\"fr\"` will be displayed in English.\n\nWarning: Please note that this datalist element is **static**, i.e. changes to its contents via scripts or expressions will not be picked up.\n\nFor a list of ids and phrases that you can copy as a starting point, use [src/locale.en.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/locale.en.js), however note that plugins can also define their own phrases.\n\n# Advanced: Customizing text via JavaScript\n\nYou can write your own localization plugin, by using `Mavo.Locale.register(languageCode, phrases)`. For an example, you can look at the [Greek localization plugin](https://plugins.mavo.io/locale-el/mavo-locale-el.js).\n\nIf you go that route, please consider adding your plugin to the [Plugins directory](https://plugins.mavo.io) so that others can benefit too!

To do that, we need the `mv-multiple` attribute, which tells mavo that **this element can be multiplied**:\n\n##### Example: Simple collection\n\n```html\nHobbies:\n<ul>\n\t<li property=\"hobby\" mv-multiple>Eating</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nNote: The `mv-multiple` attribute goes on **the element that will be multiplied, NOT the container of the collection**!\n\n* * *\n\nWe can use `property` and `mv-multiple` to create lists of more complex structures with multiple properties.\n\n##### Example: Collection of Groups\n\n```html\n<article property=\"pet\" mv-multiple>\n\t<h1 property=\"name\">Adam Catlace</h1>\n\tBorn on\n\t<time property=\"birthday\" datetime=\"2014-06-01\">1 Jun 2014</time>\n</article>\n```\n\nNote that in the example above, the `property` attribute on `<article>` does not actually make the entire `<article>` element editable, but instead acts as a **grouping element**. This will always happen when you use the `property` attribute on elements that contain other properties inside them. **Groups** have many interesting characteristics when combined with expressions, which we will see next.\n\n<p class=\"learn-more\">[Collections](/docs/collections)"

If the original element changes (e.g. perhaps that's also populated by Mavo!

					"content": "Mavo’s **expression syntax** is called MavoScript. It is similar to spreadsheet formulas, but designed to be more readable and to accommodate nested relations (which spreadsheets cannot do).\n\nThey mostly consist of the following:\n\n# Property names\n\nYou use the value of a property you have defined by just typing its name. You can see some examples in the next section. You can use any property value from anywhere in your Mavo, or even in other Mavos (in that case, you'd need to add the app id before it, like `appid.propertyName`).\n\n##### Example\n\nMove the slider and check how both expressions are updated:\n\n```html\n<p>Slider value: [strength]/100</p>\n<input type=\"range\" property=\"strength\" title=\"[strength]%\" />\n```\n\nThe values of properties depend on where your expression is placed. When you use properties inside collections you get **all values** outside the collection, and **just the value of the current item** inside a collection item.\n\n# Function calls\n\nFunctions transform values into different values, for example they can do math on a number, or tell if you some text contains some other text. They are written with their name, and then a comma-separated list of parameters in parentheses, e.g. `min(2, 5)`.\n\n<p class=\"learn-more\">[All MavoScript functions](/docs/functions/?role=function)\n\n# Operators \n\nOperators are a shorter and more readable way to write common functions. For example, imagine if every time we wanted to subtract two numbers we had to write e.g. `subtract(2, 3)`. We would end up with a ton of parentheses for even simple expressions and it would be hard to understand what the expression actually does. Instead, we can write `2 - 3` instead, which is much shorter and more readable. Mavo supports all common math and logical operators, as well as some more like `where`.\n\n<p class=\"learn-more\">[All MavoScript operators](/docs/functions/?role=operator)\n\n# Special properties\n\nSpecial properties are available in every Mavo, and start with a dollar sign ($). They contain metadata, such as [the position of the current collection item (as a number starting from 0)](docs/functions/#$index) or [the current date/time](docs/functions/#$now). \n\n<p class=\"learn-more\">[All MavoScript special properties](/docs/functions/?role=special)\n\n# Raw data\n\nA lot of the data you will be using in expressions will come from your properties. However, sometimes you want to provide your own values as parameters. These can be:\n\n- **Numbers**, by just writing the number and using `.` as the decimal separator, e.g. `5` or `-0.3`. \n- The keyword `true` and the keyword `false` represent yes/no values. For example, `30 > 3` is equal to `true` because 30 is indeed larger than 3, and `3 > 30` is equal to `false` because 3 is not larger than 30.\n- Textual values, such as `\"cat\"` or `'Mary'`. You can use single quotes, double quotes, or even no quotes if the text contains only letters, numbers, and underscores. However, if you do that, beware of potential clashes with your property names!\n- Lists of values, just like those you get by referring a collection property from outside the collection, can be written as `list(value1, value2, value3, ...)`. You can read more about [`list()` here](/docs/functions/#list).\n- Grouped key-value pairs, just like the data you get when you reference a group can be created by using the `group()` function. E.g. `group(name: 'Vector', age: 12, hobby: list('Eating', 'Sleeping', 'Purring'))`\n\nIf you are more experienced, Mavo expressions can also be made to contain arbitrary JavaScript. You can read about some of the differences between JavaScript and MavoScript [at the end of this page](#mavoscript-vs-javascript)."

Mavo will provide login controls and will not allow any edits until the viewer has logged in. If the file and/or repo does not exist, Mavo will create it upon saving.\n\nIf the logged in user **does have commit permission** (i.e. is either the creator of the repo or added as a collaborator), saving will directly save back to Github. If the logged in user **does not have commit permissions**, the data will be stored in their own profile and they will be prompted to send an _\"edit suggestion\"_ to the original owner of the data. Editing suggestions are sent as [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), with a link to view the new data in the Mavo app (by using the [`storage` URL parameter described below](#url-params)). Currently reviewing the changes between the new and old data (i.e. the _diff_) requires the ability to read JSON (unless you’re using a different format for your data). Future Mavo versions may introduce a graphical way for this as well.\n\n**You don’t need to understand how Github works to use it for storing your data.** If you don’t know what a repo or a branch is, do not worry. Just sign up for a [Github](http://github.com) account, and specify `https://github.com/USERNAME` as the value of the `mv-storage` attribute. Mavo will automatically create an `mv-data` repo for you and a file to store your data named `APP_ID.json` where `APP_ID` is the [name of your app](/docs/primer/#mv-app).\n\nIf you _do_ understand how Github works, you can specify where your data should be stored with more precision:\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>Mavo will create a file called <code>APP_ID.json</code> in that repository.</dd>\n\n\t<dt><code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/FILE_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>Mavo will assume a default branch of <code>master</code></dd>\n\n\t<dt><code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/blob/BRANCH/FILE_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>The URL Github gives you when using its file browser.

If you would instead prefer to save automatically every time data is changed, you can use the `mv-autosave` attribute on your Mavo root. The value of the attribute is the number of seconds to throttle saving by. E.g. if `mv-autosave=\"3\"`, Mavo can only save at most once every three seconds. This can be especially useful for backends which keep a change history (e.g. Github, Dropbox) to prevent flooding which would render that history useless. To disable throttling and save immediately, use `mv-autosave=\"0\"`\n\nWarning: Using `mv-autosave` with no value will default to 3, not 0. **This will change in a future release**, and it will be made to default to the expected 0. Avoid using `mv-autosave` without a value for now, unless you’re ok with that change."

You can read more about [`Mavo.Permissions` in the API documentation](/docs/api/#permissions).\n\nIn case you’re writing a backend for a JSON-based OAuth 2 service, `Mavo.Backend` includes many helpers to make this as easy as possible. Take a look at the following in the API documentation:\n\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#accessToken`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#accessToken)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#isAuthenticated`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#isAuthenticated)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#oAuthenticate`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#oAuthenticate)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#oAuthLogout`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#oAuthLogout)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#oAuthParams`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#oAuthParams)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#request`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#request)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend.apiDomain`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend.apiDomain)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend.oAuth`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend.oAuth)\n\nAnother helpful function you may write if your backend supports authentication, is the `getUser` function, which should make the API call to get user information and set `this.user`. You **must** set `this.user` **before** setting the `logout` permission to show user information in the Mavo toolbar.\n\n```js\ngetUser: function() {\n\tif (this.user) {\n\t\treturn Promise.resolve(this.user);\n\t}\n\n\treturn this.request(\"user\").then(info => {\n\t\tthis.user = { // replace the following fields with how you get username, name, profile picture, etc\n\t\t\tusername: info.getUsernameHere,\n\t\t\tname: info.getNameHere,\n\t\t\tavatar: info.getProfilePictureHere,\n\t\t\tinfo // raw info object\n\t\t};\n\n\t\t$.fire(this.mavo.element, \"mavo:login\", { backend: this });\n\t});\n},\n```\n\nYou can see examples of backend declarations in [src/backend.github.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/backend.github.js), [src/backend.dropbox.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/backend.dropbox.js) and [src/backend.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/backend.js)\n\nIf your backend may be useful to other people, please consider adding it to the [Plugin directory](https://plugins.mavo.io)!"

Feel free to experiment with them (they are only available on the unreleased 0.1.7 version of Mavo) and send us feedback, but do not deploy them on apps that you cannot change later unless you are using a local (downloaded) version of Mavo.\n\nYou define a custom action by setting the `mv-action` attribute on any element inside your Mavo app. The action is performed every time the element is clicked, or upon submission if the element is a `<form>`. You can use any of the [expression functions](/docs/mavoscript) and syntax that you are familiar with, plus a few more:\n\n- [`set(property, value)`](#set) to change one or more properties\n- [`add(collection)`](#add) to add a new blank item to a collection\n- [`add(collection, data)`](#add) to add an item with pre-filled data to a collection.\n- [`add(collection, position)`](#add) to add a blank item at a specific position.\n- [`add(collection, data, position)`](#add) to add an item at a specific position.\n- [`delete(items)`](#delete) to delete collection items or clear property values\n- [`delete(items1, items2, ...)`](#delete) to delete multiple different things\n- [`move(item, position)`](#move) to move item to a different place\n- [`move(item, collection)`](#move) to move item to a different collection\n- [`move(item, collection, position)`](#move) to move item to a different collection in a specific place\n\nYou can use multiple calls to these in an action, separated by commas (`,`), semicolons (`;`), spaces, or nothing at all. **They will be executed in the order specified.**\n\nFor example, you **can** do `mv-action=\"add(contact, person), add(friend, person)\"` to copy the same item to two collections.\n\nNote: Just like `mv-if` and `mv-value`, brackets are not required inside `mv-action`.

These could be entire collections (to empty them), or specific items. The deletion is undoable, via the usual UI that you see when you delete an item using Mavo’s generated controls. If you delete multiple items with the same action, the undoing will re-add all of them.\n\nEspecially with the `delete()` function, you may find the [`where`](/docs/functions/#where) operator useful.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-source=\"https://test.mavo.io/data/creatures.json\">\n\t<button mv-action=\"delete(cat where name = 'Vector')\">\n\t\tDelete Vector\n\t</button>\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr property=\"cat\" mv-multiple>\n\t\t\t<td property=\"name\"></td>\n\t\t\t<td property=\"age\"></td>\n\t\t\t<td><button mv-action=\"delete(cat)\">Delete cat</button></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n</div>\n```\n\nTip: There is also a `clear()` function, which is an alias of `delete()`. `clear()` may read more nicely in cases where you are emptying entire collections."

This could be either the collection itself (when using its property name from the outside) or a specific collection item.\n\n# Second parameter: What values should the new item have? (optional)\n\nThe second parameter refers to the values you want the new item to have. This could be specified in a number of ways:\n\n- another property, to copy that property’s value\n- You can create data yourself, dynamically, by using the `group()` and `list()` functions, as well as numbers, text, and `true` and `false` keywords. E.g. `group(name: 'Lea', age: 32, hobbies: list('cooking', 'coding', 'design'))`\n- You can combine the two, e.g. `group(person, age: 34)` would copy all values from `person` except `age`, which would be set to 34.\n\nIf you provide multiple values, you will get multiple new items.\n\n# Last parameter: What position should the new item(s) be inserted in? (optional)\n\nThe third parameter is the position (starting from 0) that you want the new item to be added in. \nIf not provided, then the new item will be inserted:\n\n- In the start or end of the collection, depending on its [order](/docs/collections#mv-order).\n- If your first parameter was a collection **item**, then it will be inserted before or after that item, depending on the collection [order](/docs/collections#mv-order).\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-source=\"https://test.mavo.io/data/creatures.json\">\n\t<button mv-action=\"add(cat, group(name: 'Grumpy Cat', age: 5))\">\n\t\tAdd Grumpy Cat\n\t</button>\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr property=\"cat\" mv-multiple>\n\t\t\t<td property=\"name\"></td>\n\t\t\t<td property=\"age\"></td>\n\t\t\t<td><button mv-action=\"add(cat, cat)\">Duplicate item</button></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n</div>\n```"
